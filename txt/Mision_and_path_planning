For the main control of the system, a State Machine with singleton pattern design is used. Every state is designed to be as small as possible. For the German Open 2015, we implemented three main states divided on smaller sub-states: Move, grasp and deliver.

Once we get the tasks from the referee box, the first step for every test is to drive to a specific position and an specific orientation. First we use our own path planner, based on the A* algorithm. Once we are on the desired position we smoothly approach to the service area and perform the task of grasping or delivering an object. 

As a first attempt on the RoboCup atWork competition, we decided not to try the Precision Placement and Conveyor Bel test. It was a good idea because during this attempt we had big problems with the localization and navigation, which are basic functions and limited us to try further and more difficult tests. We gain experience and improve our software so we will try this time more difficult tests.

Both the State Machine and the A* path planner algorithm could be found on GitHub under our Laboratory's repository, "autonohm/obviously". 

Only two team members from the team that took part on the german open are still active, which is a pity because we needed to reqluit almost a whole new team. That means lack of experience and most of the times no knowledge on ROS. To instruct them and simulate their software use the stdr_simulator. It increases the learning speed and allows to work and test without the need of the robot in most cases.
