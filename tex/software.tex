what should come here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item mention all software in short even if its obvious (vim, screen, top, eclipse, ...)
	\item mention why we need each piece of software
	\item we should describe the time sync from chrony \todo{Helmut}
	\item images (dd, gzip) and backup mainboard
	\item also mention ros software --> all ros packages - and what we need it for in shorts
	\item SIMULATION; own chapter or here \todo{jon}
\end{enumerate}

The software architecture is based on the Robot Operating System ROS. The actuators of the robot are controlled by the basic youBot-ROS-drivers. The system runs with Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo communication infrastructure is used to communicate and pass information between the nodes, as for example camera data or execution orders for the 5 DOF manipulator. 

Several software tools are needed for image processing and controlling the system like openCV, PCL and ROS amcl and Stack\_Navigation.
We also implemented our own software for the SLAM-Localization in ohm\_tsd\_slam which is open source in GITHUB.
