%The data provided by the Hokuyo is additionally used for collision avoidance. If an obstacle is detected, a report goes to the path planning state which adjusts the path.
%
%There is no local navigation at the moment. In case we find an obstacle owr robot would stop and replan by using again the global navigation. We are thinking about implementing a second laser scaner and base the navigacion on the Slack\_navigation from ROS. Then we would also use a local navigation.

what should come here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item describe navigation stack in short (we will use navigation from localization stack)
	\item describe problems and approach from last robocup\todo{jon}
\end{enumerate}
