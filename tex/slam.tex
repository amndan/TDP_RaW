%In order to create the map, we use the SLAM developed by our colleges in Rescue team at the Georg-Simon-Ohm University of applied science. The SLAM itself is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and laser data provided by the front-mounted Hokuyo URG04-LX laser scanner. Then we base the localization on the amcl package provided by ROS.
