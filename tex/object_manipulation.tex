To grasp objects reliably an exact position from the object perception is needed. The position of
objects will be calculated based on information, received from optical/infrared sensors (2D and 3D).
After the calculation is finished the robot will navigate to a pregrasp position. Once the base has
reached the final position, kinematics will lead the arm near the object. For precise gripping a
2D/3D optical/infrared sensor has been attached to the end effector. In gripping stance the arm-
2camera will be activated to measure the final gripping pose. Because manipulation is an upcoming
issue in our robotic institute, we decided to build our own inverse kinematic.
