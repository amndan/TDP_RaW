%In this paper we first briefly introduce our Autonohm \todo{consistent writing} team and team members. We then present the HW we use and give a brief explanation about the SW packages we are using. We also describe more in detail the software developed by us such as the 2D image processing software, mapping, localization and state machine. \todo{we also 2x}

This paper describes the participation of team AutonOHM in the RobuCup$@$work league. It provided detailed information of localization, autonomy, image processing and object manipulation. 

In future work, 3D perception will be used for object localization. Moreover, the team plans on deploying self developed software for localization and navigation and on to improve the robot autonomy.

Furthermore, it is planned to mount a second laser scanner facing backwards, in order to improve localization quality. Moreover, the second sensor would allow backwards driving as obstacles behind the robot can be detected as well.
