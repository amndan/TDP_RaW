here comes amcl/tsd slam stuff...

The Navigation is based on the ROS Navigation stack.

what should come here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item describe our two possible localization approaches (tsd and amcl)
	\item multible laser scanner setup
	\item perhaps we are able to implement a mixture
	\item we are working on this parts...
\end{enumerate}

As a first attempt on the RoboCup atWork \todo{consistent style of RaW} competition, we decided not to try the Precision Placement and Conveyor Belt test. It was a good idea because during this attempt we had big problems with the localization and navigation, which are basic functions. This limited us to try further and more difficult tests. We gain experience and improve our software so we will try this time more difficult tests.
