here comes amcl/tsd slam stuff...

The Navigation is based on the ROS Navigation stack.

what should come here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item describe our two possible localization approaches (tsd and amcl)
	\item multible laser scanner setup
	\item perhaps we are able to implement a mixture
	\item we are working on this parts...
\end{enumerate}
