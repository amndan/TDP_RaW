Every time we develop software, we try to link the ROS system as late as possible. So we can ensure good reusability and applicability on other systems. Additionally, most of the software is managed in standalone packages, which eases integrating them into other systems. By adding code to our laboratory's library\footnote{https://github.com/autonohm/obviously}, which includes many standard solutions to robotic problems, rewriting or copying of code is prevented and software maintenance is simplified.
