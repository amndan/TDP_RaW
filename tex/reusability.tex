Every time we develop software, we try to link the ROS system as late as possible. So we can ensure good reusability and applicability on other systems? Additionally most of our software is managed in standalone packages, which makes integrating them in other systems very easy. With our laboratory's library\footnote{https://github.com/autonohm/obviously}, which includes many standard solutions to robotic problems, we prevent rewriting or copying code and we simplify software maintenance.
