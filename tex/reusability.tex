\todo{@dominik is vision or parts of it from dominik organized like a standalone package? YES it is!!!!! ROS is not needed for Vision. It only gets start through rosrun}
\todo{@all: please think about that and add your ideas}
Every time we develop software, we try to link the ROS system as late as possible. So we can ensure good reusability and applicability with\todo{with?} other systems? Additionally most of our software is managed in standalone packages, which makes integrating them in other systems very easy. With our laboratory's library\footnote{https://github.com/autonohm/obviously}, which includes many standard solutions to robotic problems, we prevent rewriting or copying code and simplify software maintenance\todo{maintenance?}.
