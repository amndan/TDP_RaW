The Autonohm$@$work team at the Nuernberg Georg Simon Ohm University of Applied Sciences
was founded in September 2014. The team consists of Bachelor and Master students leaded by a
research assistant who guides and supervises them. To develop a functional mobile-robot-
manipulator the different groups in the team had put much effort and knowledge into research to
develop the packages to manage the robot. Our main focus is attended to mobile manipulation,
object perception and navigation in a unconstrained environment. \todo{to fulfill "focus of research/research interest" from the review add a bit more about that; e.g. rescue robotics, mapping, transportation robots,...}
Only two members of the team that took part last year in Magdeburg continue. To compensate that,
new members have joined us and the cooperation between the rescue and the atwork teams has been
intensified.
