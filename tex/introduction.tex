The AutonOHM$@$work team at the Nuremberg Institute of Technology Georg-Simon-Ohm
was founded in September 2014. The team consists of Bachelor and Master students, supervised by research assistants and a professor. 
%research assistant who guides and supervises them. 

The team is divided into groups, each developing specific parts of the robot control software, such as manipulation,
object detection, localization and navigation.
%To develop a functional mobile-robot-manipulator the different groups in the team had put much effort and knowledge into research to
%develop the packages to manage the robot. 
%Our main focus is attended to mobile manipulation,
%object perception and navigation in a unconstrained environment. 
%Only two members of the team that took part last year in Magdeburg continue. To compensate that,
%new members have joined us and the cooperation between the rescue and the atwork teams has been
%intensified.
AutonOHM participated for the first time in the German Open 2015, achieving the 5th place out of seven. Since this was the first competition ever, the team was satisfied with the result.
